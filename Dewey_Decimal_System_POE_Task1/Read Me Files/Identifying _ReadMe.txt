PROGRAM USAGE

STEP 1
Once the user clicks the “identifying Areas” option then a series of possible questions
to be answered or attempted are randomly generated and brought to screen.
Then the user may now pick from the provisioned series of questions.

STEP 2
Once any of the  question series options are picked then a screen conveyed in the extract is displayed
where match column questions are randomly generated for the user to attempt answering.


STEP 3
The user is provisioned with four textboxes in which they can utilize to attempt matching the correct 
call numbers to call descriptions and vice versa , they have to look at the question projected on the
top left of the screen and allude to which call number matches which description. 
The format in which the user is required to utilize to answer the questions is projected on 
the question interface .The format(700=X) where the call number itself is entered first and matched 
to the call description’s letter identifier using the equals symbol without any whitespaces in between. 


STEP 4
The user is mandated and may only use the call description letter identifiers provisioned as they are
displayed in their uppercase format in the question and the format in which user utilizes to answer
may not deviate from provided format in question.

STEP 5
The user may attempt to answer/match in any order they feel like and after each of the four textboxes
have been filled with a match attempt the user may now press the submit button and if there are any 
issues with their input the user will be notified.

STEP 6
Once “submit” is clicked this user is shown which match attempts they got correct and which match 
attempts they got wrong on the bottom right of the extract as shown there , and on the top right of 
the screen the user is conveyed their score for each question attempt.
- Where 10 points are awarded for matching everything correctly
- 7 points if only 3 call numbers are matched correctly 
- 4 points if only 2 are correct and 1 point if only one is matched accurately.

STEP 7
Then the user may click “Try Again” and they can attempt that particular question again and until
they are satisfied with their end result.

STEP 8
The user has the opportunity to alter the question series and will now have to match call descriptions 
to call numbers in the format (X=700)  with the call description Letter identifiers being matched with
call numbers and the prior knowledge is assumed for the rest of the process . 
Here user has to actually validate their input to ensure they 
don’t attempt to match using invalid input and they will get a response if it is valid or not.

STEP 9
After validation is deemed successful they user may attempt to answer the match column question of call 
descriptions to call numbers in the specified format.

STEP 10
The User can then look at the solution if the are struggling with the questions so that they can improve 
their chances of getting their match attempts correctly.
